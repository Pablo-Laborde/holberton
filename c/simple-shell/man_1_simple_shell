PROLOG

	This manual page is for a Holberton School project "Basic shell" that
	is about building your own command interpreter.

NAME
	hsh - holberton shell, command language interpreter

SYNOPSIS
	./hsh

DESCRIPTION
	The hsh utility is a command language interpreter that sall execute
	commands read from a command line string or a specified file.

OPTIONS
	This hsh version doesn't support parameters.

OPERANDS
	This hsh version doesn-t support operands.

STDIN
	The shell allows the terminal, texts or files as input.
	When more than a command, which each may contain or not arguments, the
	shell will break the input in such way each command is executed with
	it's corresponding arguments.

STDOUT
	Produces no ouput, only on failure. See STDERR section.

STDERR
	Standard error is used for diagnostic messages.
	e.g.	$ sdf
		./hsh: 1: sdf: not found

OUTPUT FILES
	This program does't produce any output file.

USAGE
	1. Interactive Mode
		./hsh

	2. Non-Interactive Mode
		echo "command and arguments" | ./hsh
			or
		cat <filename> | ./hsh

EXAMPLES
	1. Interactive Mode
		$ ls
		<display files and directories inside the pwd>
		$ cat <filename>
		<display the content of the file>
		$ exit
			# end of shell

	2. Non-Interactive Mode
		echo "ls" | ./hsh
		<display files and directories inside the pwd>
			# end of shell
		cat <filename> | ./hsh
			if <filename> content = "ls\nls"
		<display files and directories inside the pwd>
		<display files and directories inside the pwd>
			# end of shell

	Notes
		To send more than one command to the shell it's necessary to
		write them into a file and pipe into the shell like in the
		second example of non-interactive mode.

BUGS
	To inform about bugs contact Holberton School Uruguay.

	List of Bugs
		In Interactive Mode
			$ cat
				# stays in infinite loop, doesn't take next
				input as argument

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
	There are no plans of expanding the shell functioning. This might
	change in the future.
